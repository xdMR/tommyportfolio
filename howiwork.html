                    <h3>1. Morning meeting, receive photos
                    </h3>
                    <p>

                        My day as the Page One Designer for The Boston Globe begins with a
                        morning meeting involving department-head editors representing their
                        reporting teams that discuss the stories that will be available that
                        day. At the end of the meeting, the two managing editors, the two
                        editors in charge of the daily operation of the newsroom and only
                        behind the editor-in-chief in rank, give a list of which stories
                        will be considered for the the next day's front page. From there, an
                        assistant photography editor will give me all available photos
                        pertaining to the stories listed. Usually, the list contains 10-15
                        stories, which will be whittled down to 5-6 by the end of the day.

                    </p>
                    <h3>2. Conceptual thinking, gathering early supplies
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        On this particular day, the managing editors would like to display a
                        business story involving buying and renting high-end luxury condos
                        and apartments in downtown Boston. Our photo department assigns a
                        photographer to go shoot updated photos that afternoon, so in the
                        mean time, I use file photos of three of the buildings mentioned in
                        order to mock up a draft for the editors to see for our early
                        afternoon update meeting. After I make rough cutouts of the file
                        building photos, I search our stock imaging sites for cloud photos.
                        I prefer to grab at least two photos that vary in style to give
                        myself options in Photoshop without having to go back to the stock
                        site.

                    </p>
                    <img src="img/how/first.png" class="img-fluid"  alt="">

                    <h3>3. Creating the first draft of the page.
                    </h3>
                    <p>Once I have the initial rendering of the photo illustration ready, I
                        begin to build the first draft of the page in InDesign, based on
                        which other stories were mentioned in the morning meeting. At this
                        point in the day, late morning, early afternoon, the majority of
                        stories have not been filed yet, as reporters are usually conducting
                        interviews and going over their first drafts with their editors. So
                        I'll coordinate with the photo editor to showcase what we have so
                        far, along with the skyscraper illustration.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/how/second.png" class="img-fluid"  alt="">

                    <h3>4. Additional display opportunity
                    </h3>
                    <p>By the early afternoon, after my second meeting with the managing
                        editors, I have a pretty good idea of the direction of the page. I
                        am told that one of our stories is being written off of a pole we
                        gave to our readers asking various questions about current events.
                        They would like for me to create a graphic highlighting the primary
                        question from the survey. I begin that process by creating the chart
                        in Adobe Illustrator. From there, I'll take that rough copy and
                        bring it into InDesign, where I'll stylize the bars and add the
                        relevant type.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/how/third.jpg" class="img-fluid"  alt="">
                    <h3>5. Live skyscraper photos arrive
                    </h3>
                    <p>The photographer files his photos by mid-afternoon, and I take them
                        into Photoshop to cut them out and combine them with the edited
                        cloud photo. Once that is complete, I'll take the document and
                        combine it with the poll graphic to create an updated version of the
                        page, along with the photo I received earlier in the morning. I will
                        then present this at a mid-afternoon meeting with a combination of
                        department-head editors from the morning meeting and night editors
                        who will put the entire newspaper together that evening.
                    </p>
                    <h3>6. Transition to evening
                    </h3>
                    <p>The photographer files his photos by mid-afternoon, and I take them
                        into Photoshop to cut them out and combine them with the edited
                        cloud photo. Once that is complete, I'll take the document and
                        combine it with the poll graphic to create an updated version of the
